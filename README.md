# Mask Effect

This repo shows a simple implementation of the mask effect with an added interactive feature that moves the mask with the mouse position.

## Demo


## Setup

- Clone the repo.
-  `cd` to root **maskeffect**.
- `npm install`. 
- `npm run dev` after installing dependencies to run dev server.

## Compatibility

> **Note**
>
> Current version of chrome doesn't support `mask-repeat` fully so this might show up as multiple masks. Edge browser works better with this feature. Developers working on this can try `webkit-mask-repeat`
